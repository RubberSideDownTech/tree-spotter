# Session logs

- Session logs can be found in ~/.local/share/goose/sessions/
- when I ask you to list prompts for a session, us the file that was written most recently from that directory.

# Running tests

- Command to use: `npm run type-check && npm test`
- As you are making changes, run the tests to gather insight into status of codebase.
- When I tell you to run the tests, run this command.
- If you find an error in that command, fix using error message and re-run command until command runs successfully.
