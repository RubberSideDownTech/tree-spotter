# User Stories for Tree Spotter

## Infrastructure Stories

### Story 1: Basic SMS Handler Setup
**Title**: Set up basic SMS message handling with Twilio

As a trail spotter, I need to be able to send an SMS with an image to report a downed tree.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given a Twilio phone number is set up for the service
When a user sends an SMS with an image to the service number
Then the system should:
- Receive the message via Twilio webhook
- Store the message and image in Cloudflare R2
- Send a "Thank you for your submission" response
- Queue the submission for processing

**Technical Notes**:
- Set up Twilio account and configure webhook
- Create Cloudflare Worker to handle webhook
- Set up R2 bucket for image storage
- Implement basic queue system using Cloudflare Queues
- Configure auto-response message

### Story 2: Image GPS Extraction
**Title**: Implement GPS metadata extraction from images

As a system processor, I need to extract accurate GPS coordinates from uploaded images to properly locate downed trees.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given an image has been uploaded to the R2 storage
When the image processor retrieves the image
Then the system should:
- Extract EXIF metadata from the image
- Parse GPS coordinates from the metadata
- Validate coordinates are within expected range
- Store coordinates with accuracy information

**Technical Notes**:
- Use Sharp for image processing in Workers environment
- Implement EXIF metadata extraction
- Add coordinate validation logic
- Store results in KV storage

### Story 3: Tree Diameter Analysis
**Title**: Implement AI-based tree diameter analysis

As a system processor, I need to analyze images to determine tree diameter to help sawyers bring appropriate equipment.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given an image with GPS coordinates has been processed
When the AI analysis system examines the image
Then the system should:
- Run the image through the TensorFlow.js model
- Calculate the approximate tree diameter
- Store the diameter information with the submission
- Handle cases where diameter cannot be determined

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement TensorFlow.js in Workers environment
- Set up model serving infrastructure
- Create diameter calculation logic
- Implement error handling for unclear images

### Story 4: Wild Trails API Integration
**Title**: Implement Wild Trails Sawyer API integration

As a system processor, I need to submit processed tree reports to the Wild Trails Sawyer API.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given a fully processed submission with image, GPS, and diameter
When the system attempts to create a report
Then it should:
- Upload the image to /upload.php
- Create a report with all required fields via /updateDB.php
- Handle API errors appropriately
- Queue failed submissions for retry

**Technical Notes**:
- Implement multipart/form-data upload
- Create report submission logic
- Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
- Set up submission state tracking

### Story 5: Queue Management System
**Title**: Implement robust queue management system

As a system administrator, I need a reliable queue management system to handle message processing and API retries.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given multiple submissions in various states of processing
When the queue manager processes the queue
Then it should:
- Process submissions in FIFO order
- Handle failed processing attempts
- Implement retry logic with backoff
- Maintain submission state information
- Clean up completed submissions

**Technical Notes**:
- Set up Cloudflare Queues
- Implement queue processing logic
- Create state management system in KV
- Add monitoring and logging

### Story 6: Error Handling and Monitoring
**Title**: Implement comprehensive error handling and monitoring

As a system administrator, I need to monitor system health and handle errors gracefully.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given the system is processing submissions
When errors occur at any point in the process
Then the system should:
- Log detailed error information
- Notify administrators of critical failures
- Attempt appropriate recovery actions
- Maintain system stability

**Technical Notes**:
- Set up logging infrastructure
- Implement error handling throughout
- Create monitoring dashboards
- Configure alerting system

## Future Enhancement Stories

### Story 7: Image Quality Validation
**Title**: Implement image quality validation

As a system processor, I need to validate that submitted images meet minimum quality requirements.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given a new image submission
When the system processes the image
Then it should:
- Check image resolution
- Validate image clarity
- Ensure proper lighting
- Reject images that don't meet requirements
- Notify user of rejection reason

### Story 8: Submission Rate Limiting
**Title**: Implement submission rate limiting

As a system administrator, I need to prevent abuse by implementing rate limiting.

**Given/When/Then**:
Given a user submitting multiple reports
When they exceed the rate limit
Then the system should:
- Track submission frequency by phone number
- Apply rate limiting rules
- Send appropriate feedback to user
- Log rate limit events
